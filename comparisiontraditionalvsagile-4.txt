Traditional vs Agile

1. In waterfall Requirement- analysis phase is the last time business was engaged in the development process----this should be avoided
2. In agile the entire SDLC is visited with in that 2 week timeline.That sounds crazy but a small deliverable can be given 
   in that time and also can be shown to the client
3  In agile this iterative delivery approach helps client tell whether the model finalized is desired or not,and feed back 
   also can be taken right away
4. These iterative approach goes on until we get our MVP (minimal viable product)
5. The teams inherently becomes good at working on real time project
