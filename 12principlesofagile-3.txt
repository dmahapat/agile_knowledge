12 principles of Agile Software Development

1. CONTINUOUS ATTENTION TO TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE AND GOOD DESIGN

2. FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION IS THE BEST FORM OF COMMUNICATION
   No heavy mails,
   directly talk and move on
   You will be able to walk away with clear set of ideas and requiremnts

3. WORKING SOLUTION IS THE PRINCIPAL MEASURE OF PROGRESS
   This is KPI:- Key Performance Indicator
   Agile focuses on delivering something
   The only measure of progress is a working solution(This was not part of waterfall) 
   Waterfall takes 6-12 months time to deliver something 
   But agile is short and iterative and delivers something every sprint

4. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PACE
   We dont want to have peaks and valleys in development
   We want continuous development and improvement
   We can start to gauge capacity and velocity and enduser will have an idea when the product is going to be delivered

5. TEAM REGULARLY REFLECTS ON HOW TO BECOME MORE EFFFECTIVE
   At the end of every sprint release the team has a quick retrospective.
   In retrospective meetings we talk about three things
    a. What went well?
    b. What did not go well?
    c. How can we improve?

6. SIMPLICITY - THE ART OF MAXIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF WORK NOT DONE IS ESSENTIAL
   The focus should be to deliver the requirement.
   If the developer has an idea,which is nice to have but takes a lot of time,then simply focus on the basic requirement 
   forget everythingelse

7. THE BEST ARCHITECTURES,REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGNS COME FROM SELF ORGANIZING TEAMS
   We have all the team members at the same location and everyone is working towards the common goal
   The self organizing teams should come up with the best technical solution out there

8. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY EARLY AND CONTINUOUS DELIVERY
   This kind of goes back to the point no 3.

9. WELCOME CHANGE IN REQUIREMENTS
   We are okay with change in requirements over following a plan

10. WORKING SOLUTION SHOULD BE DELIVERED FREQUENTLY (WEEKS VS MONTHS)
    Kind of goes back to point no 3

11. CLOSE,DAILY COOPERATION BETWEEN BUSINESS AND DEVELOPERS
    So that the business is aligned with what we are working on

12. PROJECTS ARE BUILT AROUND MOTIVATED INDIVIDUALS AND TRUST SHOULD BE BUILT IN in THE TEAM
    Teams are trusted to do what we know they can do the best
