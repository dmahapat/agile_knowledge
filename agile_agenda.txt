1. Agile Manifesto(Policy,aims,goals)

 a.INDIVIDUAL interactions are better than PROCESS,TOOLS and SOFTWARES in project management
 b.WORKING S/W over COMPREHENSIVE documentation
   1.Because of the heavy dependency on documentation waterfall model was unsuccessful.
   2.End user doesnot care about a thick piece of documentation(it shows the pieces of task done)
     But end user cares about the working software....it effective shows the amount of work done and also what work is done
 c.CUSTOMER COLLABORATION over CONTRACT NEGOTIATION
   CONTRACT NEGOTIATION: is a service provider and client approach - in agile we should avoid it
   Rather we should be working in a collaborative way. Hence the name customer collaboration
 d.RESPONDING TO CHANGE over FOLLOWING A PLAN
   We should not be following a strict plan in development.
   We want to be okay with chnages coming in mid way.Let's shift gears and work together
