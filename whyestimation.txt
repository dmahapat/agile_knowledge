Estimation drives planning

Key takeaway:

	1. we estimate in size to derive duration

	2. when we estimate in duration it gets very arbitrary

	Tools to estimate size:

        a. Ideal days :

			when estimating in ideal days you assume that 

			1. The story being estimated is the only thing you work on

			2. Everything will be in hand when you start

			3. There will be 0 interruptions

			4. when estimating in ideal days use 1 estimate,not many

			5. 1 guy saying 10 ideal days and another is saying 5 ideal days is not allowed.

			6. Avoid the temptation to estimate the US by individual or group.

			7. Emphasize on "we" mentality

			8. 

	b. story points
